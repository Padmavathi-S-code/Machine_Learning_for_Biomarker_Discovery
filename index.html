    <h1>Hello!Everyone This is my mini project on machine learning for biomarker discovery that i did in my internship in NyBerman Bioinformatics.</h1>
    <p1>This project applies machine learning techniques to identify potential biomarkers associated with Parkinson’s disease using a synthetic dataset. It involves building and comparing multiple machine learning models to discover meaningful biological patterns that can help in early detection and understanding of the disease. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation to determine the most significant features contributing to disease prediction. Through this approach, the project aims to demonstrate how computational methods can support biomarker discovery and advance research in precision medicine for neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
